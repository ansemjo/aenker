## aenker



### Synopsis

Aenker is a tool to encrypt files with an authenticated integrated encryption
scheme by chunking the input into equal parts and sealing them with a key
derived from an anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange on an elliptic curve.

Many parties can encrypt files for a single recipient by distributing that
recipient's public key, while only the recipient can decrypt any of those files
afterwards.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for aenker
```
